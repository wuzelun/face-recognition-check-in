# MVVM Architecture for SwiftUI + Combine

A demo project showcasing the setup of the SwiftUI app with MVVM Architecture.

The app uses the [restcountries.com](https://restcountries.com/) REST API to show the list of countries and details about them.

**Check out [master branch](https://github.com/nalexn/clean-architecture-swiftui) for the Clean Architecture revision of the same app.**

For the example of handling the **authentication state** in the app, you can refer to my [other tiny project](https://github.com/nalexn/uikit-swiftui) that harnesses the locks and keys principle for solving this problem.

## Key features
* Vanilla **SwiftUI** + **Combine** implementation
* Decoupled **Presentation**, **Business Logic**, and **Data Access** layers
* Full test coverage, including the UI (thanks to the [ViewInspector](https://github.com/nalexn/ViewInspector))
* **Redux**-like centralized `AppState` as the single source of truth
* Data persistence with **CoreData**
* Native SwiftUI dependency injection
* **Programmatic navigation**. Push notifications with deep link
* Simple yet flexible networking layer built on Generics
* Handling of the system events (such as `didBecomeActive`, `willResignActive`)
* Built with SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI in mind
* Designed for scalability. It can be used as a reference for building large production apps

### Presentation Layer

**SwiftUI views** that contain no business logic and are a function of the state.

Side effects are triggered by the user's actions (such as a tap on a button) or view lifecycle event `onAppear` and are forwarded to the `ViewModel`.

`ViewModel` also serves as the data source for the View. `ViewModel` is injected into the view as a constructor parameter.

### Business Logic Layer

Business Logic Layer is represented by `ViewModels` and `Services`.

`Services` receive requests to perform work, such as obtaining data from an external source or making computations, but they never return data back directly.

Instead, they forward the result to the `AppState` or to a `Binding`. The latter is used when the result of work (the data) is used locally by one `ViewModel` and does not belong to the `AppState`.

`ViewModel` works as an intermediary between `View` and `Services`, encapsulating business logic local to the view. It is observing changes in the `AppState`, providing up-to-date data to the `View` through `Bindings`.

[Previously](https://github.com/nalexn/clean-architecture-swiftui/releases/tag/1.0), this app did not use CoreData for persistence, and all loaded data were stored in the `AppState`.

With the persistence layer in place we have a choice - either to load the DB content onto the `AppState`, or serve the data from `Services` on an on-demand basis through `Binding`.

The first option suits best when you don't have a lot of data, for example, when you just store the last used login email in the `UserDefaults`. Then, the corresponding string value can just be loaded onto the `AppState` at launch and updated by the `Service` when the user changes the input.

The second option is better when you have massive amounts of data and introduce a fully-fledged database for storing it locally.

### Data Access Layer

Data Access Layer is represented by `Repositories`.

Repositories provide asynchronous API (`Publisher` from Combine) for making [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations on the backend or a local database. They don't contain business logic, neither do they mutate the `AppState`. Repositories are accessible and used only by the Services.
